The EPA National Student Services Contract has an immediate opening for a part-time Data Scientist position with the Office of Research and Development at the EPA facility in Research Triangle Park, NC.
The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country.
What the EPA project is about
The EPA Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) is responsible for developing new computational tools and providing quantitative analysis for improving public health and environmental risk assessments and regulatory decisions pertaining to chemical safety. CCTE researchers integrate advances in biology, biotechnology, chemistry, and computer science to identify important biological processes that may be disrupted by the chemicals. The combined information helps prioritize chemicals based on potential human health risks. Using computational toxicology research, thousands of chemicals can be evaluated for potential risk at small cost in a very short amount of time.

EPA is responsible for ensuring the safety of thousands of chemicals but quantitative exposure data are available for only a small fraction of registered chemicals. As part of its ongoing efforts to support implementation of the Toxic Substance Act as revised by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, EPA researchers are developing innovative methods to make exposure estimates for thousands of chemicals. These type of exposure data are combined with toxicity data to help thoroughly evaluate chemicals for potential health effects (https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/rapid-chemical-exposure-and-dose-research).
Responsibilities:
As a team member, you will provide data management, data curation and data analysis support for EPA’s HTTK and ExpoCast project. This project focuses on analyzing a database of in vitro toxicokinetic data, application of machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest) to generate predictive models, and the creation of R packages to package and distribute the R code and data for re-use by others. Toxicokinetics describes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of chemicals by the body. Toxicokinetic information is needed to understand the risks posed by chemicals in the environment to the public health. The team member will be a member of a multi-disciplinary research team and support the development, maintenance, and analysis of EPA’s HTTK and ExpoCast projects.

Data Development and Analysis responsibilities will include:
Implementation of machine learning techniques using caret (R) or and/or Sci-Kit learn (Python);
Preparation and quality control of data and workflows;
Creation of metadata and fact sheets supporting the data products; and
Literature review.

Communications-related responsibilities will include:
Participating as a member of a multi-disciplinary research team;
Interacting with other members of the development team as well as EPA scientists; and
Documenting code via Bitbucket and GitHub.

Required Knowledge, Skills, Work Experience, and Education
Strong written, oral, and electronic communication skills;
Experience programming in R or Python; and
Experience in machine learning.

Desired Knowledge, Skills, Work Experience, and Education
Experience in chemical informatics and
Experience documenting code via Bitbucket and/or Github.

Location: This job will be located EPA’s facility in Research Triangle Park, NC.
Salary: Selected applicant will become a temporary employee of ORAU and will receive an hourly wage of $28.52 for hours worked.
Hours: Part-time.

How to Apply

Description
The EPA National Student Services Contract has an immediate opening for a part-time Data Scientist position with the Office of Research and Development at the EPA facility in Research Triangle Park, NC.
The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country.
What the EPA project is about
The EPA Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) is responsible for developing new computational tools and providing quantitative analysis for improving public health and environmental risk assessments and regulatory decisions pertaining to chemical safety. CCTE researchers integrate advances in biology, biotechnology, chemistry, and computer science to identify important biological processes that may be disrupted by the chemicals. The combined information helps prioritize chemicals based on potential human health risks. Using computational toxicology research, thousands of chemicals can be evaluated for potential risk at small cost in a very short amount of time.
EPA is responsible for ensuring the safety of thousands of chemicals but quantitative exposure data are available for only a small fraction of registered chemicals. As part of its ongoing efforts to support implementation of the Toxic Substance Act as revised by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, EPA researchers are developing innovative methods to make exposure estimates for thousands of chemicals. These type of exposure data are combined with toxicity data to help thoroughly evaluate chemicals for potential health effects (https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/rapid-chemical-exposure-and-dose-research).
What experience and skills will you gain?
As a team member, you will provide data management, data curation and data analysis support for EPA’s HTTK and ExpoCast project. This project focuses on analyzing a database of in vitro toxicokinetic data, application of machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest) to generate predictive models, and the creation of R packages to package and distribute the R code and data for re-use by others. Toxicokinetics describes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of chemicals by the body. Toxicokinetic information is needed to understand the risks posed by chemicals in the environment to the public health. The team member will be a member of a multi-disciplinary research team and support the development, maintenance, and analysis of EPA’s HTTK and ExpoCast projects.
Data Development and Analysis responsibilities will include:
Implementation of machine learning techniques using caret (R) or and/or Sci-Kit learn (Python);
Preparation and quality control of data and workflows;
Creation of metadata and fact sheets supporting the data products; and
Literature review.
Communications-related responsibilities will include:
Participating as a member of a multi-disciplinary research team;
Interacting with other members of the development team as well as EPA scientists; and
Documenting code via Bitbucket and GitHub.
Required Knowledge, Skills, Work Experience, and Education
Strong written, oral, and electronic communication skills;
Experience programming in R or Python; and
Experience in machine learning.
Desired Knowledge, Skills, Work Experience, and Education
Experience in chemical informatics and
Experience documenting code via Bitbucket and/or Github.

About Avalara:
About Avalara:
We’re building cloud-based tax compliance solutions to handle every transaction in the world. Imagine every transaction you make — every tank of gas, cup of coffee, or pair of sneakers, every movie ticket, meal kit, or streamed song, every sensor-to-sensor ping. Nearly every time you make a purchase, physical or digital, there’s an accompanying unique and nuanced tax compliance calculation. The logic behind calculating taxes — the rules, rates, and boundaries is a global, layered, three-dimensional mess of complexity, with compliance dictated by governments and applied by every business, every day.

Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds. That’s a massive technical challenge, in terms of scale, reliability, and complexity, and we do it better than anyone. That’s why we’re growing fast. Headquartered in Seattle, Avalara has offices across the U.S. and around the world, in Brazil, Canada, India, U.K, Belgium and across Europe.

Equal Opportunities:
Avalara is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified candidates will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, colour, creed, religion, age, gender, national orientation, disability, sexual orientation, US Veteran status, or any other factor protected by law."
