The EPA National Student Services Contract has an immediate opening for a part-time Data Scientist position with the Office of Research and Development at the EPA facility in Research Triangle Park, NC.
The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country.
What the EPA project is about
The EPA Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) is responsible for developing new computational tools and providing quantitative analysis for improving public health and environmental risk assessments and regulatory decisions pertaining to chemical safety. CCTE researchers integrate advances in biology, biotechnology, chemistry, and computer science to identify important biological processes that may be disrupted by the chemicals. The combined information helps prioritize chemicals based on potential human health risks. Using computational toxicology research, thousands of chemicals can be evaluated for potential risk at small cost in a very short amount of time.

EPA is responsible for ensuring the safety of thousands of chemicals but quantitative exposure data are available for only a small fraction of registered chemicals. As part of its ongoing efforts to support implementation of the Toxic Substance Act as revised by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, EPA researchers are developing innovative methods to make exposure estimates for thousands of chemicals. These type of exposure data are combined with toxicity data to help thoroughly evaluate chemicals for potential health effects (https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/rapid-chemical-exposure-and-dose-research).
Responsibilities:
As a team member, you will provide data management, data curation and data analysis support for EPA’s HTTK and ExpoCast project. This project focuses on analyzing a database of in vitro toxicokinetic data, application of machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest) to generate predictive models, and the creation of R packages to package and distribute the R code and data for re-use by others. Toxicokinetics describes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of chemicals by the body. Toxicokinetic information is needed to understand the risks posed by chemicals in the environment to the public health. The team member will be a member of a multi-disciplinary research team and support the development, maintenance, and analysis of EPA’s HTTK and ExpoCast projects.

Data Development and Analysis responsibilities will include:
Implementation of machine learning techniques using caret (R) or and/or Sci-Kit learn (Python);
Preparation and quality control of data and workflows;
Creation of metadata and fact sheets supporting the data products; and

How to Apply

Description
The EPA National Student Services Contract has an immediate opening for a part-time Data Scientist position with the Office of Research and Development at the EPA facility in Research Triangle Park, NC.
The Office of Research and Development at the EPA supports high-quality research to improve the scientific basis for decisions on national environmental issues and help EPA achieve its environmental goals. Research is conducted in a broad range of environmental areas by scientists in EPA laboratories and at universities across the country.
What the EPA project is about
The EPA Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) is responsible for developing new computational tools and providing quantitative analysis for improving public health and environmental risk assessments and regulatory decisions pertaining to chemical safety. CCTE researchers integrate advances in biology, biotechnology, chemistry, and computer science to identify important biological processes that may be disrupted by the chemicals. The combined information helps prioritize chemicals based on potential human health risks. Using computational toxicology research, thousands of chemicals can be evaluated for potential risk at small cost in a very short amount of time.
EPA is responsible for ensuring the safety of thousands of chemicals but quantitative exposure data are available for only a small fraction of registered chemicals. As part of its ongoing efforts to support implementation of the Toxic Substance Act as revised by the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, EPA researchers are developing innovative methods to make exposure estimates for thousands of chemicals. These type of exposure data are combined with toxicity data to help thoroughly evaluate chemicals for potential health effects (https://www.epa.gov/chemical-research/rapid-chemical-exposure-and-dose-research).
What experience and skills will you gain?
As a team member, you will provide data management, data curation and data analysis support for EPA’s HTTK and ExpoCast project. This project focuses on analyzing a database of in vitro toxicokinetic data, application of machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest) to generate predictive models, and the creation of R packages to package and distribute the R code and data for re-use by others. Toxicokinetics describes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of chemicals by the body. Toxicokinetic information is needed to understand the risks posed by chemicals in the environment to the public health. The team member will be a member of a multi-disciplinary research team and support the development, maintenance, and analysis of EPA’s HTTK and ExpoCast projects.
Data Development and Analysis responsibilities will include:
Implementation of machine learning techniques using caret (R) or and/or Sci-Kit learn (Python);
Preparation and quality control of data and workflows;
Creation of metadata and fact sheets supporting the data products; and

About Avalara:
About Avalara:
We’re building cloud-based tax compliance solutions to handle every transaction in the world. Imagine every transaction you make — every tank of gas, cup of coffee, or pair of sneakers, every movie ticket, meal kit, or streamed song, every sensor-to-sensor ping. Nearly every time you make a purchase, physical or digital, there’s an accompanying unique and nuanced tax compliance calculation. The logic behind calculating taxes — the rules, rates, and boundaries is a global, layered, three-dimensional mess of complexity, with compliance dictated by governments and applied by every business, every day.

Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds. That’s a massive technical challenge, in terms of scale, reliability, and complexity, and we do it better than anyone. That’s why we’re growing fast. Headquartered in Seattle, Avalara has offices across the U.S. and around the world, in Brazil, Canada, India, U.K, Belgium and across Europe.

When a BI system is well-designed and properly integrated into a company's processes and decision-making process, it may be able to improve a company's performance. Having access to timely and accurate information is an important resource for a company, which can expedite decision-making and improve customers' experience.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (39 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.
Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components.

Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more.
https://www.recruitingfromscratch.com/
Our Client
We are a venture-backed startup building the infrastructure layer for Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance. Integrating technology in the insurance industry today is much like consumer finance pre-Plaid (we could succinctly be described as ""Plaid for Insurance""), or payments pre-Stripe, and our vision is to unlock a similar wave of innovation for the $2T global P&C industry.
Today, walking into an insurance agency is like stepping into a time machine. Filing cabinets, fax machines, piles of incoming and outgoing mail. What you don't see is that even for the parts that have been ""digitized"", needless manual work abounds. Few systems communicate directly, leading to endless copy-pasting from emails to various proprietary web portals/desktop apps and back again.
Carrier by carrier, endpoint by endpoint, we will bring each of those manual and error-prone workflows into our simple, modern API layer.
The implementation details are subject to change, but this is our north star, and the future we envision isn't possible without it.
What we're looking for
We are seeking a highly autonomous engineer (employee #2!) excited about owning the design and implementation of a robust, API-driven product and playing a foundational role in the formation of the company.
Responsibilities
You'll work closely with the team and early customers to build a world-class, API-driven product.
You'll solve hard technical problems from scratch, owning the solution through the entire development lifecycle.
You'll help define the tech stack/architecture for a fledgling product — we're technology agnostic and focus using the right tool for the job.
You'll contribute to the creation of the team culture, as well as internal tooling and processes.
Role requirements
4+ years professional backend/full-stack engineering experience. Working on large-scale open-source projects works too. You've played significant roles in either API design, building processing pipelines, or systemic integration of external systems.
Early-stage startup experience (or other similar unstructured, fast-paced environment)
Live in or willing to relocate to the Bay Area to work full-time in our SF office
Nice to haves
Experience with web scraping, email scraping, RPA — in general just getting data creatively out of hard-to-reach places
1+ years TypeScript/JavaScript experience in a professional or large-scale OSS setting. If you have a comprehensive side project you think is equivalent, send it our way! Clear, concise, and extensible code is important to us and collaborating with others is often a forcing function to that end.
Experience integrating with low tech industries, or other time spent integrating with poorly documented, antiquated APIs (and sometimes even a lack thereof)
Why you should join us
Opportunity to be a foundational team member to a well-funded, post-product and -revenue startup in a massive and largely untapped industry.
Hard backend engineering problems on day 1. Backend is all we do, and the projects you'll work on will be challenging and interesting.
Generous equity comp (90th+ percentile) and competitive cash comp (50th percentile). As we're a startup, we're happy to play with the balance for exceptional candidates.
The Founding Team
Our CEO is a strong engineer in his own right (Waterloo grad, senior eng at multiple Bay Area startups) but will be focusing on the business/product side. He’s gone super deep on insurance, including getting a Broker License and a stint as an Insurtech EIR at a top VC firm.
We’ve raised funding from great investors including top seed funds, ex-Plaid folks, and insurance industry insiders.
Salary Range: $160,000-$180,000 base.
